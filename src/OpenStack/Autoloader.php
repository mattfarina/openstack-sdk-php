 * Autoload the OpenStack library.
 *
 * The OpenStack library is natively designed to be available via Composer. When
 * Composer is not available and there is not another PSR-0 compatible autoloader
 * to use, this one can be used.
 *
 * The autoloader can be used like:
 *
 * @code
 * Autoloader::useAutoloader();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @attention
 * The structure of the OpenStack file hierarchy is PSR-0 compliant.
 * This means that you can use any standard PSR-0 classloader to
 * load all of the classes here.
 *
 * That said, many projects rely upon packages to handle their own
 * class loading. To provide this, this package contains a custom
 * classloader that will load JUST the OpenStack classes. See
 * the Autoloader::useAutoloader() static method.
 *
 * See https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md
